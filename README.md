# NC News

This repository contains a website that was developed during [Northcoders Software Engineering Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp), front-end project week. It constitutes a news website with articles on various topics, where users can  view articles by category, up-vote and down-vote articles by other users, comment on articles and delete their own comments.

**Hosted version of the website is available [here](https://ncnews-by-viksil.netlify.app/).** Please note that the website is very slow to load due to free tier of Render in the backend.<br>

Video demo of the website can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/Kdx5pjnXCHc).

The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/VikSil/NC-news-backend-API).

Instructions below will explain how to run this website locally.

## Prerequisites

Local version of the back-end is **not** required for the front-end website to run locally.

Prerequisites for running this website locally are:

* Node.js with npm (version 20.8.0 or higher)
* Git

To make sure that all prerequisites are installed, run the following commands in the terminal:

```
    node --version
    npm --version
    git --version
```

If all return sensible looking version numbers, proceed with the setup. Otherwise, look into [these](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) instructions for setting up Node and npm, and [these](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) instructions for setting up Git.

## Setup and installation

To set up the website and run it on your local machine:

 1. Create a directory where the project will be contained and `cd` your terminal into that directory. 
 1. Clone this repository onto your local machine by running the following command: 
 
```
    git clone https://github.com/VikSil/NC-news-frontend.git
```


 3. Run command: `cd NC*` to change into the repo directory.
 1. Run the following command to install dependencies (this will take several minutes to complete):

 ```
    npm install
 ```
The above command will result in a message about the number of packages that have been added and audited. If the message contains information about any vulnerabilities, run the following command:

```
    npm audit fix
```


## Starting the website

Run the following command to start the website:

```
    npm run dev
```
The above command should output the following message:
